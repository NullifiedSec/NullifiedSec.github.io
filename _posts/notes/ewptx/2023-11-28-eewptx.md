# My Review

|Difficulty: ★★★☆☆|
|Price: ★★★☆☆| $400 |
|Material: ★★★☆☆|
|Real-World Scenario: ★★★☆☆|
|Worth it?: Yes, If you want to specialize in Web Pentesting. |
|Official Site: [eWPTX by INE](https://security.ine.com/certifications/ewptx-certification/)|

> WEB oriented there is eWPTX and OSWE. The first being Black-box and the second White-box

> As all INE content, I think this course can be updated

> Maybe in the future I'll try the exam.
